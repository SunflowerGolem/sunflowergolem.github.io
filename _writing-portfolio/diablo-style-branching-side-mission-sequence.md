The tale begins at Nightfall Citadel, where the main hero stumbles upon a tragedy – a dying woman's plea to save her child, taken to the cursed village of Thornfield. Venturing into Thornfield reveals a gruesome secret: a curse forces the villagers into a horrific choice – sacrifice a child each year or transform into monstrous entities. But is it really the curse forcing them?
