[Spase adventure RPG mission](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n9pdNng3fVB0QUl0mfa--TQhTiSXfmSg/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} is a sample of a side quest or mission for an RPG or adventure game set in a futuristic or cyberpunk environment. It showcases the game writer's work in crafting a short quest sequence plot, introducing several NPCs. The focus is on providing players with meaningful choices that influence gameplay style and have consequences within the game world.

The mission unfolds as the hero is tasked with rescuing a group of captives, including Zephyr, the young son of the wealthy AI-assistants development company founder from an asteroid controlled by alien gangs. What starts as a seemingly straightforward rescue mission eventually takes an unexpected turn.

This quest combines elements of stealth, puzzle-solving, and space combat, offering players a dynamic experience as the hero navigates the asteroid's dangers and uncovers the truth. The mission introduces unique characters, such as Zephyr and his father, and features twists and turns that keep players engaged.
