[The plot structure of a steampunk adventure game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gzQJCbVXZqlm6YPVwo2flwc-3PKWIdB/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} highlights the game writer's skill in crafting a comprehensive outline and synopsis, employing such techniques as the three-act structure and the hero's journey for game plots.

In the steampunk city of Gearhaven, advanced machinery unexpectedly turns into perilous mechanisms, disrupting the once-thriving industrial society. Locals dub it the Shadow Curse, yet its essence and origin remain a mystery. The main hero, a daring and ambitious airship captain and smuggler discovers that he unknowingly transported some artifact - a part of machinery that might be connected to the Shadow Curse.
From this point his adventures have only began.
