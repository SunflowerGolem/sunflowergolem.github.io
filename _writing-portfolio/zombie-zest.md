[Zombie Zest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDQ6Z9xsPKP3GgHTSqCsSLeZUPoOwjAQ/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} is a sample showcasing the creative use of character barks in a zombie survival comedy game. This text presents a game similar to Left for Dead, featuring three characters with unique personalities and histories, navigating through a zombie apocalypse. This sample showcases how character barks can enrich the gaming experience, highlight the unique traits of each character, and add a layer of fun to challenging situations.
 
The sample is divided into three sections: brief bios of the three characters, their general barks, and a mission sequence that includes both a short cutscene dialogue and mission-specific barks.
